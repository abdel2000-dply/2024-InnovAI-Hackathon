# MajlisAI - AI Meeting Assistant

## Abstract

### Background and Problem Statement
Meetings are an essential aspect of professional life but often lead to wasted time and inefficiency. The average professional spends over 15 hours per week in meetings, with much of this time lost to unproductive discussions, forgotten action items, and inadequate follow-ups. In Morocco, where 81% of professionals prefer remote work, the challenge of effective meeting management becomes even more pressing.

### Impact and Proposed Solution
MajlisAI aims to revolutionize meeting management with an AI-powered assistant that supports Darija, Arabic, French, and English. This innovative tool not only transcribes audio but also summarizes discussions, creates actionable to-do lists, and allows users to query meeting transcripts via an interactive chat. By transforming meeting data into meaningful insights, MajlisAI enhances productivity, fosters better collaboration, and supports professionals in maximizing the value of their time.

### Project Outcomes and Deliverables
A functional Streamlit web application that:
- Transcribes audio files and live recordings.
- Summarizes key meeting points.
- Generates to-do lists and provides interactive chat for transcript queries.
- Support for multiple languages (English, Arabic, Moroccan Darija, and French).
- Documentation and resources to enable easy deployment and usage.
- A demo video showcasing MajlisAI in action.
